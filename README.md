# Chatter
A localhost chat app



Chatter is at the very first steps of development, so feel free to message me with any problems that occur while you are using it.

#Directions for Usage:

-make sure you have python 3.8 or higher
  -You can check your version by typing "python3 --version" in your terminal
  -Python usually comes preinstalled on a Mac
  -You can install python on a Windows machine using microsoft store
  -Install PySide6 using pip install "python3 -m pip install PySide6"
 
-download zip
-unzip the package

-Run the server first (serverGUI.py)
  -the first box should say "localhost" which just means create a server on your computer
  -the second box should say "port" which is the port that the server will run on. (choose a high 4-digit port number as lower numbers are commonly used by your machine)
  -Remember your port number (very import for clients to connect)
  

-Run the client now (chat.py)
  -in the chat bar (small text strip at the bottom of the window), delete the text that is already there, and type "localhost:PORT" where PORT is your 4-digit port number you used earlier
 
 -If everything goes correctly you should get the "Welcome to this chatroom!" message
 
 -Repeat the client step to create more clients (make copies of chat.py instead of running chat.py Your all your chatapps will quit otherwise)
